                                <p>I am working on a sample reactjs application (in learning process). I have a page which list the list of users and a add button to add a new user.
                                    When I click the add button I should navigate to the User Form to create the new user.
                                    After I click the submit button in the user form it should navigate back to the first page where it should list the list of users along with the new user.
                                    How to navigate between pages in react?</p>
